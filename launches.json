Located on the east coast of Florida, KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS).","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_27_20200803142447.jpg","timezone_name":"America/New_York","total_launch_count":264,"total_landing_count":0},"country_code":"USA","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_87_20200803143537.jpg","total_launch_count":206,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":205},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png","infographic":null,"program":[{"id":25,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/","name":"Starlink","description":"Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX","agencies":[{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}],"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg","start_date":"2018-02-22T14:17:00Z","end_date":null,"info_url":"https://starlink.com","wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink","mission_patches":[{"id":7,"name":"Space X Starlink Mission Patch","priority":10,"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png","agency":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}}],"type":{"id":3,"name":"Communication Constellation"}}],"orbital_launch_attempt_count":6948,"location_launch_attempt_count":265,"pad_launch_attempt_count":207,"agency_launch_attempt_count":507,"orbital_launch_attempt_count_year":99,"location_launch_attempt_count_year":13,"pad_launch_attempt_count_year":13,"agency_launch_attempt_count_year":58,"type":"normal"},{"id":"0ab25471-b026-4252-93ab-89d91c1a7f4d","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/0ab25471-b026-4252-93ab-89d91c1a7f4d/","slug":"falcon-9-block-5-starlink-group-15-4","name":"Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 15-4","status":{"id":8,"name":"To Be Confirmed","abbrev":"TBC","description":"Awaiting official confirmation - current date is known with some certainty."},"last_updated":"2025-05-06T17:21:41Z","net":"2025-05-13T00:00:00Z","window_end":"2025-05-13T04:00:00Z","window_start":"2025-05-13T00:00:00Z","net_precision":{"id":2,"name":"Hour","abbrev":"HR","description":"The T-0 is accurate to the hour."},"probability":null,"weather_concerns":null,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"},"rocket":{"id":8601,"configuration":{"id":164,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/164/","name":"Falcon 9","family":"Falcon","full_name":"Falcon 9 Block 5","variant":"Block 5"}},"mission":{"id":7193,"name":"Starlink Group 15-4","description":"A batch of satellites for the Starlink mega-constellation - SpaceX's project for space-based Internet communication system.","launch_designator":null,"type":"Communications","orbit":{"id":8,"name":"Low Earth Orbit","abbrev":"LEO"},"agencies":[{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","featured":true,"type":"Commercial","country_code":"USA","abbrev":"SpX","description":"Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California.
