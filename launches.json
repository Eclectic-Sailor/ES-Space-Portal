Located on the east coast of Florida, KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS).","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_27_20200803142447.jpg","timezone_name":"America/New_York","total_launch_count":271,"total_landing_count":0},"country_code":"USA","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_87_20200803143537.jpg","total_launch_count":213,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":212},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png","infographic":null,"program":[{"id":25,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/","name":"Starlink","description":"Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX","agencies":[{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}],"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg","start_date":"2018-02-22T14:17:00Z","end_date":null,"info_url":"https://starlink.com","wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink","mission_patches":[{"id":7,"name":"Space X Starlink Mission Patch","priority":10,"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png","agency":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}}],"type":{"id":3,"name":"Communication Constellation"}}],"orbital_launch_attempt_count":7050,"location_launch_attempt_count":272,"pad_launch_attempt_count":214,"agency_launch_attempt_count":564,"orbital_launch_attempt_count_year":201,"location_launch_attempt_count_year":20,"pad_launch_attempt_count_year":20,"agency_launch_attempt_count_year":115,"type":"normal"},{"id":"a0310ea9-b526-4c9b-b767-90872c1cdafd","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/a0310ea9-b526-4c9b-b767-90872c1cdafd/","slug":"falcon-9-block-5-starlink-group-17-9","name":"Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 17-9","status":{"id":1,"name":"Go for Launch","abbrev":"Go","description":"Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."},"last_updated":"2025-08-29T02:40:57Z","net":"2025-09-06T15:42:00Z","window_end":"2025-09-06T19:42:00Z","window_start":"2025-09-06T15:42:00Z","net_precision":{"id":1,"name":"Minute","abbrev":"MIN","description":"The T-0 is accurate to the minute."},"probability":null,"weather_concerns":null,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"},"rocket":{"id":8695,"configuration":{"id":164,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/164/","name":"Falcon 9","family":"Falcon","full_name":"Falcon 9 Block 5","variant":"Block 5"}},"mission":{"id":7287,"name":"Starlink Group 17-9","description":"A batch of 24 satellites for the Starlink mega-constellation - SpaceX's project for space-based Internet communication system.","launch_designator":null,"type":"Communications","orbit":{"id":8,"name":"Low Earth Orbit","abbrev":"LEO"},"agencies":[{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","featured":true,"type":"Commercial","country_code":"USA","abbrev":"SpX","description":"Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California.
