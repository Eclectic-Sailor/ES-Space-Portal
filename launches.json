Another launch site is being developed at Boca Chica, Texas.","administrator":"CEO: Elon Musk","founding_year":"2002","launchers":"Falcon | Starship","spacecraft":"Dragon","launch_library_url":null,"total_launch_count":503,"consecutive_successful_launches":26,"successful_launches":489,"failed_launches":14,"pending_launches":119,"consecutive_successful_landings":72,"successful_landings":450,"failed_landings":26,"attempted_landings":475,"info_url":"http://www.spacex.com/","wiki_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_logo_20220826094919.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_image_20190207032501.jpeg","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_nation_20230531064544.jpg"}],"info_urls":[],"vid_urls":[]},"pad":{"id":16,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/16/","agency_id":null,"name":"Space Launch Complex 4E","description":"Space Launch Complex 4 East (SLC-4E) is a launch site at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, U.S.\r\n\r\nThe pad was previously used by Atlas and Titan rockets between 1963 and 2005.
