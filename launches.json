Established in 1941, Vandenberg Space Force Base is a space launch base, launching spacecraft from the Western Range, and also performs missile testing. The United States Space Force's Space Launch Delta 30 serves as the host delta for the base, equivalent to an Air Force air base wing. In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg","timezone_name":"America/Los_Angeles","total_launch_count":826,"total_landing_count":28},"country_code":"USA","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg","total_launch_count":212,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":212},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png","infographic":null,"program":[{"id":25,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/","name":"Starlink","description":"Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX","agencies":[{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}],"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg","start_date":"2018-02-22T14:17:00Z","end_date":null,"info_url":"https://starlink.com","wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink","mission_patches":[{"id":7,"name":"Space X Starlink Mission Patch","priority":10,"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png","agency":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}}],"type":{"id":3,"name":"Communication Constellation"}}],"orbital_launch_attempt_count":7051,"location_launch_attempt_count":828,"pad_launch_attempt_count":214,"agency_launch_attempt_count":565,"orbital_launch_attempt_count_year":202,"location_launch_attempt_count_year":42,"pad_launch_attempt_count_year":40,"agency_launch_attempt_count_year":116,"type":"normal"},{"id":"84a2a107-1e44-4994-ad9f-430ee81a741a","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/84a2a107-1e44-4994-ad9f-430ee81a741a/","slug":"falcon-9-block-5-nusantara-lima","name":"Falcon 9 Block 5 | Nusantara Lima","status":{"id":2,"name":"To Be Determined","abbrev":"TBD","description":"Current date is a placeholder or rough estimation based on unreliable or interpreted sources."},"last_updated":"2025-08-30T21:01:45Z","net":"2025-09-08T00:00:00Z","window_end":"2025-09-08T00:00:00Z","window_start":"2025-09-08T00:00:00Z","net_precision":{"id":5,"name":"Day","abbrev":"DAY","description":"The T-0 is expected on the given day."},"probability":null,"weather_concerns":null,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"},"rocket":{"id":7545,"configuration":{"id":164,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/164/","name":"Falcon 9","family":"Falcon","full_name":"Falcon 9 Block 5","variant":"Block 5"}},"mission":{"id":5972,"name":"Nusantara Lima","description":"Nusantara Lima is an Indonesian geostationary communications satellite with a capacity of more than 160 Gbps.","launch_designator":null,"type":"Communications","orbit":{"id":2,"name":"Geostationary Transfer Orbit","abbrev":"GTO"},"agencies":[{"id":1070,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/1070/","name":"PT Pasifik Satelit Nusantara","featured":false,"type":"Private","country_code":"IDN","abbrev":"PSN","description":"PT Pasifik Satelit Nusantara (PSN) is a private Indonesian satellite telecommunications company.\r\n\r\nIt was formed in 1991 and was the first satellite-based telecommunications company in Indonesia.
