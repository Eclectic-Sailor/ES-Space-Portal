Originally developed as an ICBM site for the R-7 missile, it also served for numerous satellite launches using the R-7 and other rockets. Its high latitude makes it useful only for certain types of launches, especially the Molniya orbits, so for much of the site's history it functioned as a secondary location, with most orbital launches taking place from Baikonur, in the Kazakh SSR. With the end of the Soviet Union, Baikonur became a foreign territory, and Kazakhstan charged $115 million usage fees annually. Consequently, Plesetsk has seen considerably more activity since the 2000s.","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_6_20200803142434.jpg","timezone_name":"Europe/Moscow","total_launch_count":1675,"total_landing_count":0},"country_code":"RUS","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_85_20200803143554.jpg","total_launch_count":324,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":324},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/soyuz_2.1b_image_20230802085331.jpg","infographic":null,"program":[],"orbital_launch_attempt_count":6962,"location_launch_attempt_count":1675,"pad_launch_attempt_count":324,"agency_launch_attempt_count":144,"orbital_launch_attempt_count_year":113,"location_launch_attempt_count_year":4,"pad_launch_attempt_count_year":2,"agency_launch_attempt_count_year":3,"type":"normal"},{"id":"b37179f7-1d22-4398-bd58-1d50d9d58344","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/b37179f7-1d22-4398-bd58-1d50d9d58344/","slug":"falcon-9-block-5-starlink-group-11-16","name":"Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 11-16","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful","abbrev":"Success","description":"The launch vehicle successfully inserted its payload(s) into the target orbit(s)."},"last_updated":"2025-05-23T23:41:52Z","net":"2025-05-23T22:32:20Z","window_end":"2025-05-24T00:36:00Z","window_start":"2025-05-23T20:36:00Z","net_precision":{"id":0,"name":"Second","abbrev":"SEC","description":"The T-0 is accurate to the second."},"probability":null,"weather_concerns":null,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"},"rocket":{"id":8612,"configuration":{"id":164,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/164/","name":"Falcon 9","family":"Falcon","full_name":"Falcon 9 Block 5","variant":"Block 5"}},"mission":{"id":7204,"name":"Starlink Group 11-16","description":"A batch of 27 satellites for the Starlink mega-constellation - SpaceX's project for space-based Internet communication system.","launch_designator":null,"type":"Communications","orbit":{"id":8,"name":"Low Earth Orbit","abbrev":"LEO"},"agencies":[{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","featured":true,"type":"Commercial","country_code":"USA","abbrev":"SpX","description":"Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California.
