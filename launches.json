Originally developed as an ICBM site for the R-7 missile, it also served for numerous satellite launches using the R-7 and other rockets. Its high latitude makes it useful only for certain types of launches, especially the Molniya orbits, so for much of the site's history it functioned as a secondary location, with most orbital launches taking place from Baikonur, in the Kazakh SSR. With the end of the Soviet Union, Baikonur became a foreign territory, and Kazakhstan charged $115 million usage fees annually. Consequently, Plesetsk has seen considerably more activity since the 2000s.","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_6_20200803142434.jpg","timezone_name":"Europe/Moscow","total_launch_count":1675,"total_landing_count":0},"country_code":"RUS","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_42_20200803143543.jpg","total_launch_count":8,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":8},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/angara_a52fbri_image_20240102171438.jpg","infographic":null,"program":[],"orbital_launch_attempt_count":6984,"location_launch_attempt_count":1676,"pad_launch_attempt_count":9,"agency_launch_attempt_count":145,"orbital_launch_attempt_count_year":135,"location_launch_attempt_count_year":5,"pad_launch_attempt_count_year":2,"agency_launch_attempt_count_year":4,"type":"normal"},{"id":"0f16b696-d248-4096-9be7-953802c569b2","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/0f16b696-d248-4096-9be7-953802c569b2/","slug":"electron-symphony-in-the-stars","name":"Electron | Symphony In The Stars","status":{"id":1,"name":"Go for Launch","abbrev":"Go","description":"Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."},"last_updated":"2025-06-17T02:07:46Z","net":"2025-06-20T07:15:00Z","window_end":"2025-06-20T07:15:00Z","window_start":"2025-06-20T07:15:00Z","net_precision":{"id":1,"name":"Minute","abbrev":"MIN","description":"The T-0 is accurate to the minute."},"probability":null,"weather_concerns":null,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":147,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/147/","name":"Rocket Lab","type":"Commercial"},"rocket":{"id":8642,"configuration":{"id":26,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/26/","name":"Electron","family":"","full_name":"Electron","variant":""}},"mission":{"id":7234,"name":"Symphony In The Stars","description":"'Symphony In The Stars' is the first of two dedicated missions on Electron to deploy a single spacecraft to a 650 km circular Earth orbit for a confidential commercial customer.\r\n\r\nA second dedicated launch on Electron to meet those same mission requirements is scheduled for launch before the end of 2025.","launch_designator":null,"type":"Unknown","orbit":{"id":17,"name":"Sun-Synchronous Orbit","abbrev":"SSO"},"agencies":[],"info_urls":[],"vid_urls":[]},"pad":{"id":210,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/210/","agency_id":null,"name":"Unknown Pad","description":null,"info_url":null,"wiki_url":null,"map_url":null,"latitude":"-39.260881","longitude":"177.865826","location":{"id":10,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/10/","name":"Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand","country_code":"NZL","description":"Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 is a commercial spaceport located close to Ahuriri Point at the southern tip of Māhia Peninsula, on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island.
