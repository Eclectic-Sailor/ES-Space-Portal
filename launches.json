China.\r\n\r\nFormally a suborbital test center, it currently serves as China's southernmost spaceport. The site was selected for its low latitude, 19° north of the equator, allowing for larger payloads to be launched. It is capable of launching the Long March 5, the heaviest Chinese rocket. Unlike launch facilities on the mainland, Wenchang uses its seaport for deliveries.","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_8_20200803142445.jpg","timezone_name":"Asia/Shanghai","total_launch_count":41,"total_landing_count":0},"country_code":"CHN","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_commercial_lc-2_20231225074048.jpg","total_launch_count":1,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":1},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/cz-12_on_its_la_image_20241128132937.jpg","infographic":null,"program":[],"orbital_launch_attempt_count":7022,"location_launch_attempt_count":42,"pad_launch_attempt_count":2,"agency_launch_attempt_count":534,"orbital_launch_attempt_count_year":173,"location_launch_attempt_count_year":8,"pad_launch_attempt_count_year":1,"agency_launch_attempt_count_year":33,"type":"normal"}]}
