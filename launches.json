Another launch site is being developed at Boca Chica, Texas.","administrator":"CEO: Elon Musk","founding_year":"2002","launchers":"Falcon | Starship","spacecraft":"Dragon","launch_library_url":null,"total_launch_count":531,"consecutive_successful_launches":16,"successful_launches":516,"failed_launches":15,"pending_launches":116,"consecutive_successful_landings":16,"successful_landings":477,"failed_landings":27,"attempted_landings":503,"info_url":"https://www.spacex.com/","wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_logo_20220826094919.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_image_20190207032501.jpeg","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_nation_20230531064544.jpg"}],"info_urls":[],"vid_urls":[]},"pad":{"id":80,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/80/","agency_id":121,"name":"Space Launch Complex 40","description":"","info_url":null,"wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Space_Launch_Complex_40","map_url":"https://www.google.com/maps?q=28.56194122,-80.57735736","latitude":"28.56194122","longitude":"-80.57735736","location":{"id":12,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/12/","name":"Cape Canaveral SFS, FL, USA","country_code":"USA","description":"Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS) is an installation of the United States Space Force's Space Launch Delta 45, located on Cape Canaveral in Brevard County, Florida.","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_12_20200803142519.jpg","timezone_name":"America/New_York","total_launch_count":1034,"total_landing_count":65},"country_code":"USA","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_80_20200803143323.jpg","total_launch_count":317,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":317},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png","infographic":null,"program":[{"id":25,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/","name":"Starlink","description":"Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX","agencies":[{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}],"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg","start_date":"2018-02-22T14:17:00Z","end_date":null,"info_url":"https://starlink.com","wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink","mission_patches":[{"id":7,"name":"Space X Starlink Mission Patch","priority":10,"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png","agency":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}}],"type":{"id":3,"name":"Communication Constellation"}}],"orbital_launch_attempt_count":6992,"location_launch_attempt_count":1035,"pad_launch_attempt_count":318,"agency_launch_attempt_count":532,"orbital_launch_attempt_count_year":143,"location_launch_attempt_count_year":41,"pad_launch_attempt_count_year":38,"agency_launch_attempt_count_year":83,"type":"normal"},{"id":"87d3fde4-e6f6-4e8b-bc9a-d5c28915acb3","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/87d3fde4-e6f6-4e8b-bc9a-d5c28915acb3/","slug":"h-iia-202-gosat-gw","name":"H-IIA 202 | GOSAT-GW","status":{"id":1,"name":"Go for Launch","abbrev":"Go","description":"Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."},"last_updated":"2025-06-24T05:10:24Z","net":"2025-06-28T16:33:03Z","window_end":"2025-06-28T16:52:00Z","window_start":"2025-06-28T16:33:03Z","net_precision":{"id":0,"name":"Second","abbrev":"SEC","description":"The T-0 is accurate to the second."},"probability":null,"weather_concerns":null,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":37,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/37/","name":"Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency","type":"Government"},"rocket":{"id":156,"configuration":{"id":32,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/32/","name":"H-IIA","family":"H-II","full_name":"H-IIA 202","variant":"202"}},"mission":{"id":5892,"name":"GOSAT-GW","description":"GOSAT-GW (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite Greenhouse gases and Water cycle), formerly known as GOSAT 3, is JAXA's next generation satellite to monitor the greenhosue gases like carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere.
