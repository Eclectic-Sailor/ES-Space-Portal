In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg","timezone_name":"America/Los_Angeles","total_launch_count":840,"total_landing_count":29},"country_code":"USA","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg","total_launch_count":226,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":226},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png","infographic":null,"program":[{"id":25,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/","name":"Starlink","description":"Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX","agencies":[{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}],"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg","start_date":"2018-02-22T14:17:00Z","end_date":null,"info_url":"https://starlink.com","wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink","mission_patches":[{"id":7,"name":"Space X Starlink Mission Patch","priority":10,"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png","agency":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}}],"type":{"id":3,"name":"Communication Constellation"}}],"orbital_launch_attempt_count":7102,"location_launch_attempt_count":842,"pad_launch_attempt_count":228,"agency_launch_attempt_count":593,"orbital_launch_attempt_count_year":253,"location_launch_attempt_count_year":56,"pad_launch_attempt_count_year":54,"agency_launch_attempt_count_year":144,"type":"normal"},{"id":"5ca83f30-9e3d-439c-ac1d-b57953943355","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/5ca83f30-9e3d-439c-ac1d-b57953943355/","slug":"long-march-2fg-shenzhou-21","name":"Long March 2F/G | Shenzhou 21","status":{"id":1,"name":"Go for Launch","abbrev":"Go","description":"Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."},"last_updated":"2025-10-20T17:19:02Z","net":"2025-10-31T15:44:00Z","window_end":"2025-10-31T16:14:00Z","window_start":"2025-10-31T15:34:00Z","net_precision":{"id":1,"name":"Minute","abbrev":"MIN","description":"The T-0 is accurate to the minute."},"probability":null,"weather_concerns":null,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":88,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/88/","name":"China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation","type":"Government"},"rocket":{"id":8559,"configuration":{"id":84,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/84/","name":"Long March 2","family":"Long March","full_name":"Long March 2F/G","variant":"F/G"}},"mission":{"id":7150,"name":"Shenzhou 21","description":"Tenth crewed flight to the Chinese space station.","launch_designator":null,"type":"Human Exploration","orbit":{"id":8,"name":"Low Earth Orbit","abbrev":"LEO"},"agencies":[{"id":17,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/17/","name":"China National Space Administration","featured":true,"type":"Government","country_code":"CHN","abbrev":"CNSA","description":"The China National Space Administration (CNSA) is the national space agency of the People's Republic of China.
