Its high latitude makes it useful only for certain types of launches, especially the Molniya orbits, so for much of the site's history it functioned as a secondary location, with most orbital launches taking place from Baikonur, in the Kazakh SSR. With the end of the Soviet Union, Baikonur became a foreign territory, and Kazakhstan charged $115 million usage fees annually. Consequently, Plesetsk has seen considerably more activity since the 2000s.","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_6_20200803142434.jpg","timezone_name":"Europe/Moscow","total_launch_count":1677,"total_landing_count":0},"country_code":"RUS","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_42_20200803143543.jpg","total_launch_count":10,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":10},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/angara25201.2_image_20190224012254.jpeg","infographic":null,"program":[],"orbital_launch_attempt_count":7037,"location_launch_attempt_count":1677,"pad_launch_attempt_count":10,"agency_launch_attempt_count":146,"orbital_launch_attempt_count_year":188,"location_launch_attempt_count_year":6,"pad_launch_attempt_count_year":3,"agency_launch_attempt_count_year":5,"type":"normal"},{"id":"2d5f2335-c3c2-4306-9dde-8ec37f348ccf","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/2d5f2335-c3c2-4306-9dde-8ec37f348ccf/","slug":"falcon-9-block-5-otv-8-x-37b-ussf-36","name":"Falcon 9 Block 5 | OTV-8 (X-37B) (USSF-36)","status":{"id":1,"name":"Go for Launch","abbrev":"Go","description":"Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."},"last_updated":"2025-08-21T23:47:40Z","net":"2025-08-22T03:50:00Z","window_end":"2025-08-22T07:40:00Z","window_start":"2025-08-22T03:40:00Z","net_precision":{"id":1,"name":"Minute","abbrev":"MIN","description":"The T-0 is accurate to the minute."},"probability":65,"weather_concerns":"Cumulus Cloud Rule, Anvil Cloud Rules","holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"},"rocket":{"id":7857,"configuration":{"id":164,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/164/","name":"Falcon 9","family":"Falcon","full_name":"Falcon 9 Block 5","variant":"Block 5"}},"mission":{"id":6365,"name":"OTV-8 (X-37B) (USSF-36)","description":"Eighth flight of the X-37B program. \r\n\r\nThe X-37B is a dynamic and responsive spacecraft responsible for conducting a range of tests and experiments that expedite the development of critical next-generation technologies and operational concepts for reusable space capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe OTV-8 mission in Low Earth Orbit includes operational demonstrations and experiments of next-generation technologies, including laser communications and the highest performing strategic grade quantum inertial sensor ever tested in space.
