Established in 1941, Vandenberg Space Force Base is a space launch base, launching spacecraft from the Western Range, and also performs missile testing. The United States Space Force's Space Launch Delta 30 serves as the host delta for the base, equivalent to an Air Force air base wing. In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg","timezone_name":"America/Los_Angeles","total_launch_count":816,"total_landing_count":26},"country_code":"USA","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg","total_launch_count":202,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":202},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png","infographic":null,"program":[{"id":25,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/","name":"Starlink","description":"Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX","agencies":[{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}],"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg","start_date":"2018-02-22T14:17:00Z","end_date":null,"info_url":"https://starlink.com","wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink","mission_patches":[{"id":7,"name":"Space X Starlink Mission Patch","priority":10,"image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png","agency":{"id":121,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/","name":"SpaceX","type":"Commercial"}}],"type":{"id":3,"name":"Communication Constellation"}}],"orbital_launch_attempt_count":7005,"location_launch_attempt_count":818,"pad_launch_attempt_count":204,"agency_launch_attempt_count":540,"orbital_launch_attempt_count_year":156,"location_launch_attempt_count_year":32,"pad_launch_attempt_count_year":30,"agency_launch_attempt_count_year":91,"type":"normal"}]}
