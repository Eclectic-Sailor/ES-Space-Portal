Located on the east coast of Florida, KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS).","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_27_20200803142447.jpg","timezone_name":"America/New_York","total_launch_count":268,"total_landing_count":0},"country_code":"USA","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_87_20200803143537.jpg","total_launch_count":210,"orbital_launch_attempt_count":209},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20220301072106.jpeg","infographic":null,"program":[{"id":5,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/5/","name":"Commercial Crew Program","description":"The Commercial Crew Program (CCP) is a human spaceflight program operated by NASA, in association with American aerospace manufacturers Boeing and SpaceX.
